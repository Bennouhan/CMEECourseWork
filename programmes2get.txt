python y
r base and r dev, y I think?
atom y  use markdown language, good apparently
tmux? - dont need to keep terminal open when running big job. Not getting yet but maybe at some point
IDE is that thing I want. R studio for R (y), Py charm (maybe have? check later) for python. Also may be powsible in vs code

Both MSc and MREs students must try to attend all the Thursday seminars unless told otherwise,
even if one is rescheduled to a day other than Thursday. You will write a half-page on at least 12
of these seminars and create a “seminar journal” for submission as part of the coursework mark (see
section on the Coursework Element). The goal is to get you to broaden your exposure to and thinking
about topics/sub-fields in Ecology/Evolution/Biology. The diaries are not assessed for beauty of prose
or scientific rigour, but on the basis of how good the logical structure of the entry/account for each
seminar is. Please do not exceed 1/2 page per seminar’s entry/account.
The Seminar diary is due at the end of the Spring term (email a pdf to course director; see section
2.2).

In python, you delineate a function (recall what a function means from the table above) by using indentation. For example:
REMEMBER TO LEAVE A BLANK LINE AFtER FUNCTION!

def foo(x):
    x *= x # (same as x = x*x) #squares the number in bracket
    print (x) #prints output; but can't set value to a variable
    return x #returns output;allows you to store it, eg y=foo(2), y would be set as 4

Now you will have a function object called foo in your workspace. You can check this using the %whos magic command, which lists and describes all the objects in your workspace:

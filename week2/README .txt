This is all the assessed coursework from Week 2 (12th Oct - 18th Oct 2020) of the CMEE course at Silwood Campus, Imperial College London. 

All work was done through VSCode on a system running Ubuntu 20.04, and is explained in further details in The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist book (link below).

Topics covered this week include introductions to:

 - Basics of Python syntax and data structures

 - Pythonâ€™s object-oriented features

 - Learning to use the ipython environment

 - How to write and run python code

 - Understand and implement Python control flow tools

 - Writing, debugging, using, and testing Python functions

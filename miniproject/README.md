# Description
<br/>


This is the full Mini-Project of the CMEE course at Silwood Campus, Imperial College London. <br/><br/>

All work was done through VSCode on a system running Ubuntu 20.04, and is explained in further detail in The Multilingual Quantitative Biologist book (link below). <br/><br/>

The project comprises a workflow, ecoded by /code/run_MiniProject.sh, which extracts bacterial growth data from the .csv file in the data directory, prepares it for analysis, uses it to fit various models (both linear and non-linear), then plots and further analyses those models. It then compiles the written report into a pdf file Ben_Nouhan_Report.pdf - please read this for further understanding of the background behind this project.

# File List
<br/>

## **miniproject/code/**
<br/>

run_MiniProject.sh &emsp;-&emsp; runs Miniproject workflow: data prep, modelling, analysis, plotting & compilation. All initial fits are also plotted if switched on with any argument.
1_prep_data.py &emsp;-&emsp; imports data frame from LogisticGrowthData.csv, cleans it up, adds unique experiment ID to each experiment, outputs to preped_data.csv

2_fit_models.R &emsp;-&emsp; imports preped_data.csv as data frame, fits the data from each experiment to various models, plots them (if plotting switched on) and adds BIC and R-squared values calculated for them to ID_dictionary_expanded.csv for subsequent analyses

3_analyse_fits.R &emsp;-&emsp; compares the fits from fit_models.R, performs weighted analyses, and outputs tables into the results/tables/ directory for use in 5_report.tex

4_plot_figures.R &emsp;-&emsp; plots formal figures as PDFs for use in 5_report.tex

5_compile_report.sh &emsp;-&emsp; Compiles 5_report.tex into Ben_Nouhan_Report.pdf, the project's formal form of presentation

5_library.bib &emsp;-&emsp; collection of referenfces for report bibliography, generated by Mendeley

5_report.tex &emsp;-&emsp; raw LaTeX form of the report

5_report.sum\*\* &emsp;-&emsp; main text word count of 5_report.tex


                  
<br/><br/>

## **miniproject/data/** 

<br/>

LogisticGrowthData.csv &emsp;-&emsp; logistic growth data from over 305 experiments from various studies; basis for the project

preped_data.csv\*\* &emsp;-&emsp; tidied version of LogisticGrowthData.csv, output from 1_prep_data.py

ID_dictionary.csv\*\* &emsp;-&emsp; compacted version of preped_data.csv, each row corresponding to one experiment with one ID, output from 1_prep_data.py

ID_dictionary_expanded.csv\*\* &emsp;-&emsp; horizontally expanded version of ID_dictionary.csv, with added columns containing results from analyses from 2_fit_models.R, including parameter estimates and fit metrics

goodfits.csv\*\* &emsp;-&emsp; vertically reduced version of ID_dictionary_expanded.csv, excluding datasets which failed a filtering test, output by 3_analyse_fits.R


<br/><br/>

## **miniproject/results/** 

<br/>

figures/\*.pdf\*\* &emsp;-&emsp; .pdf files created by 4_plot_figures.R for use as figures in 5_report.tex

plots/\*.pdf\*\* &emsp;-&emsp; .pdf files created by 2_fit_models.R, for viewing the resulting fits of each model on each dataset. Switched off by default in run_MiniProject.sh

tables/\*.csv\*\* &emsp;-&emsp; .csv files created by 3_analyse_fits.R for use as tables in 5_report.tex

Ben_Nouhan_Report.pdf\*\* &emsp;-&emsp; formal presentation of the report in PDF format

### Whatever first thing is













# Final plotting and analysis script Â¶

# Next, write a script that imports the results from the previous step and plots
#   every curve with the two(or more) models(or none, if nothing converges) overlaid.

# Doing this will help you identify poor fits visually and help you decide whether
#  the model fitting(e.g., using NLLS) can be further optimized.

# All plots should be saved in a single separate sub - directory.

# This script will also perform any analyses of the results of the Model fitting, for
#  example to summarize which model(s) fit(s) best, and address any biological
#  questions involving co - variates.

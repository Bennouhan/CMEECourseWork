### Whatever first thing is


#'..data/preped_data.csv'





# Model fitting script ¬∂

# A separate script that does the Model fitting. For example, it may have the 
#   following features:

#    -Opens the(new, modified) dataset from previous step.

#    -Does model fitting. Ultimately you need to fit at least one mechanistic or
#       nonlinear model along with one or more linear models, but for building
#       your workflow, just go ahead an fit a couple of different linear models
#       (e.g., linear regression bvs quadratic and / or cubic polynomial) .

#    -Calculates AIC, BIC, R2, and other statistical measures of model fit
#       (you decide what you want to include; isn't R2 no good here?

#    -Exports the results to a csv that the final plotting script can read.



# Note:

# Some data series(e.g., a single growth rate or functional response curve) may
#   have insufficient data points for fitting a particular model.

# That is, the number of unique x - axis values is ‚â§ùëò, where ùëò is the number of
#   parameters in the model(e.g., a regression line has two parameters). 

# Your model fitting will fail on such datasets, but you can deal with those
#   failures later (e.g., by using the try keyword that you have learned in
#   both Python and R chapters).
  
# In particular, the model fitting(or estimation of goodness of fit statistics)
#   will fail for datasets with small sample sizes, and you can then filter
#   these datasets after the Model fitting script has finished running and you
#   are in the Analysis phase.

#look at past students! and current, all on github
# eg https://github.com/Bennouhan/Coursework/tree/master/Miniproject/Code
#   run_Miniproject.sh shows order of scripts - try do an extra model at least
